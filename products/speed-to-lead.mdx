  Your specific webhook URL will be provided in your Avoca dashboard under **Settings → Integrations → Speed to Lead Webhook**

## Integration Guides

### Simple HTML Form Example

Here's a basic HTML form that sends data directly to the Avoca webhook:

```html
<form
  action="https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/speed-to-lead/abc123"
  method="POST"
>
  <input type="text" name="customer_name" placeholder="Your Name" required />
  <input type="tel" name="phone_number" placeholder="Phone Number" required />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

This simple form will POST the data directly to your webhook endpoint when submitted.

      <Step title="Install Code Snippets Plugin">
        Since the Webhooks Add-On requires an Elite plan, use this free code-based approach:
        1. Go to **Plugins → Add New**
        2. Search for **"Code Snippets"**
        3. Install and Activate
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Add Webhook Code">
        Go to **Snippets → Add New** and paste this code:
        ```php
        add_action('gform_after_submission', function($entry, $form) {
          $webhook_url = 'https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/speed-to-lead/abc123';

          $payload = [
            // Required fields
            'customer_name'  => rgar($entry, '1'), // Replace '1' with your field ID
            'phone_number'   => rgar($entry, '2'), // Replace '2' with your field ID
            
            // Optional fields - uncomment and set field IDs as needed
            // 'email'         => rgar($entry, '3'),
            // 'address'       => rgar($entry, '4'),
            // 'city'          => rgar($entry, '5'),
            // 'state'         => rgar($entry, '6'),
            // 'zip'           => rgar($entry, '7'),
            // 'notes'         => rgar($entry, '8'),
            // 'service_type'  => rgar($entry, '9'),
          ];

          // Remove empty values from payload
          $payload = array_filter($payload);

          wp_remote_post($webhook_url, [
            'method'    => 'POST',
            'headers'   => ['Content-Type' => 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'],
            'body'      => $payload,
          ]);
        }, 10, 2);
        ```
        
        **Important**: Replace the field IDs ('1', '2', etc.) with your actual field IDs from your form.
        
        Set to **"Run snippet everywhere"** and click **Save Changes and Activate**
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Embed Form on Page">
        Edit any WordPress page and add the form using either:
        - **Gravity Forms block** (Gutenberg editor)
        - **Shortcode**: `[gravityform id="1" title="false" description="false"]`
        
        Replace `id="1"` with your actual form ID (shown under Forms → All Forms)
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Test Your Integration">
        1. Visit the page with your form
        2. Fill in test data (use your phone number)
        3. Submit the form
        4. Verify the webhook fires and check your Avoca dashboard
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    <Info>
      **Alternative to Code Snippets**: You can add the PHP code directly to your theme's `functions.php` file if you have access. The Code Snippets plugin is recommended as it's safer and persists through theme updates.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Form Settings">
    In the Webflow Designer, select your form element and open the settings panel
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Form Action">
    In the form settings, set the **Action** field to your Avoca webhook URL:
    ```
    https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/speed-to-lead/abc123
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Method to POST">
    Ensure the **Method** is set to `POST`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Hidden Fields">
    Add hidden input fields for metadata:
    ```html
    <input type="hidden" name="source" value="webflow">
    <input type="hidden" name="form_name" value="contact-form">
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Field Names">
    Ensure your form input names match Avoca's expected fields:
    - `customer_name` - Full name (required)
    - `phone_number` - Phone number (required)
    - `email` - Email address (optional)
    - `message` - Any additional details (optional)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Success/Error States">
    Create success and error states in Webflow for better user experience
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Publish and Test">
    Publish your site and submit a test lead to verify the integration
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Webflow Limitation**: Native Webflow forms don't support direct webhook integration. For advanced features, consider using:
  - **Zapier or Make**: Connect Webflow forms to Avoca via automation platforms
  - **Custom Code**: Use Webflow's custom code feature to handle form submission via JavaScript
</Warning>

### Custom JavaScript Solution for Webflow

For more control over the webhook integration:

```javascript
// Add this to your Webflow site's custom code (before </body> tag)
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const form = document.getElementById('your-form-id');
  
  form.addEventListener('submit', async function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    const formData = new FormData(form);
    const data = Object.fromEntries(formData);
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/speed-to-lead/abc123', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          customer_name: data.customer_name,
          phone_number: data.phone_number,
          email: data.email,
          message: data.message,
          source: 'webflow-custom'
        })
      });
      
      if (response.ok) {
        // Show success message
        document.querySelector('.success-message').style.display = 'block';
        form.reset();
      } else {
        // Show error message
        document.querySelector('.error-message').style.display = 'block';
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
      document.querySelector('.error-message').style.display = 'block';
    }
  });
});
```

## Webhook Payload Format

Your webhook accepts both JSON and form-urlencoded data with the following fields:

```json
{
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "phone_number": "+1234567890",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "city": "Springfield",
  "state": "IL",
  "zip": "62701",

  "service_type": "plumbing",
  "source": "website-form"
}
```

### Required Fields

### Optional Fields
- `email` - Email address
- `address` - Street address

- Additional custom fields can be included and will be stored in the raw webhook data

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optimize Form Fields">
    Keep forms short with only essential fields. Every additional field reduces conversion by 7%. Let our AI gather additional information during the call.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set Clear Expectations">
    Add text near your form: "We'll call you within 30 seconds!" This prepares leads for the immediate response.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mobile Optimization">
    Ensure phone number fields are tel input types for better mobile experience:
    ```html
    <input type="tel" name="phone_number" placeholder="Phone Number" required>
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Lead Routing Rules">
    Configure routing rules in Avoca to send different types of leads to specific team members based on service type, location, or urgency.

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
  If leads aren't triggering calls, check these common issues:
</Warning>

1. **Webhook URL**: Ensure you're using your specific account webhook URL
2. **Phone Format**: Phone numbers must include country code (+1 for US)
3. **Field Names**: Form field names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
4. **SSL Certificate**: Your website must have HTTPS enabled
5. **CORS Policy**: Some forms may require CORS headers configuration
