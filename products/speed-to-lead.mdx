<Warning>
  **Webflow Limitation**: Native Webflow forms don't support direct webhook integration. For advanced features, consider using:
  - **Zapier or Make**: Connect Webflow forms to Avoca via automation platforms
  - **Custom Code**: Use Webflow's custom code feature to handle form submission via JavaScript
</Warning>

### Custom JavaScript Solution for Webflow

For more control over the webhook integration:

```javascript
// Add this to your Webflow site's custom code (before </body> tag)
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const form = document.getElementById('your-form-id');
  
  form.addEventListener('submit', async function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    const formData = new FormData(form);
    const data = Object.fromEntries(formData);
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.avoca.ai/webhooks/speed-to-lead/{your-custom-webhook-id}', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          name: data.name,
          phone: data.phone,
          email: data.email,
          message: data.message,
          source: 'webflow-custom'
        })
      });
      
      if (response.ok) {
        // Show success message
        document.querySelector('.success-message').style.display = 'block';
        form.reset();
      } else {
        // Show error message
        document.querySelector('.error-message').style.display = 'block';
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
      document.querySelector('.error-message').style.display = 'block';
    }
  });
});
```

## Webhook Payload Format

  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "email": "john@example.com",

  "source": "website-form",
  "custom_fields": {
    "service_type": "plumbing",
    "urgency": "urgent",
    "preferred_time": "morning"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optimize Form Fields">
    Keep forms short with only essential fields. Every additional field reduces conversion by 7%. Let our AI gather additional information during the call.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set Clear Expectations">
    Add text near your form: "We'll call you within 30 seconds!" This prepares leads for the immediate response.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mobile Optimization">
    Ensure phone number fields are tel input types for better mobile experience:
    ```html
    <input type="tel" name="phone" required>
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Lead Routing Rules">
    Configure routing rules in Avoca to send different types of leads to specific team members based on service type, location, or urgency.

3. **Field Names**: Form field names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
4. **SSL Certificate**: Your website must have HTTPS enabled
5. **CORS Policy**: Some forms may require CORS headers configuration
