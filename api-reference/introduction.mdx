## Overview

The Avoca AI API provides programmatic access to our AI-powered communication and scheduling platform for home service businesses. This REST API enables developers to integrate Avoca's voice AI, scheduling, messaging, and analytics capabilities into their applications.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.avoca.ai/v1
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
X-Workspace-ID: YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID
```

<Note>
To obtain your API credentials, log in to your [Avoca Dashboard](https://app.avoca.ai) and navigate to Settings â†’ API Keys.
</Note>

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and system stability, the following rate limits apply:

- **1,000** requests per minute per API key
- **10,000** requests per hour per workspace

Rate limit information is included in all API responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 998
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1642521600
```

## Quick Start Example

Here's a simple example using Speed-to-Lead:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
import { AvocaClient } from '@avoca/node-sdk';

const client = new AvocaClient({
  apiKey: process.env.AVOCA_API_KEY,
  workspaceId: process.env.WORKSPACE_ID
});

// Trigger speed-to-lead call
const response = await client.speedToLead.trigger({
  teamId: 123,
  customerName: 'John Doe',
  phoneNumber: '(555) 123-4567',
  leadSource: 'Website Form',
  serviceType: 'HVAC Repair'
});

console.log('Speed-to-lead call scheduled:', response.data.id);
```

```python Python
from avoca import AvocaClient
import os

client = AvocaClient(
    api_key=os.environ["AVOCA_API_KEY"],
    workspace_id=os.environ["WORKSPACE_ID"]
)

# Trigger speed-to-lead call
response = client.speed_to_lead.trigger(
    team_id=123,
    customer_name='John Doe',
    phone_number='(555) 123-4567',
    lead_source='Website Form',
    service_type='HVAC Repair'
)

print(f"Speed-to-lead call scheduled: {response['data']['id']}")
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.avoca.ai/v1/outbound/speed-to-lead/webhook \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-ID: YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "team_id": 123,
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "phone_number": "(555) 123-4567",
    "lead_source": "Website Form",
    "service_type": "HVAC Repair"
